Aljazeera network is my favourite news and documentaries channel. Aljazeera made a rare example in the Arab world for professional media. I made a WordPress widget to fetch the latest news from aljazeera.net website.

The plugin is pretty simple. Fetching the RSS feed and displaying it. It uses Simple Pie library which is already packed with WordPress, and it caches the RSS feed on the server to decrease the number of requests.

The layout is flexible and has a variable width. You have the option to hide Aljazeera logo and link, you can also display a small description of each news item. When you hover over a title you will see the time of this news item in GMT, the WordPress time locale format will be used.

The plugin was approved and hosted at WordPress plugin directory. You can download it from WordPress admin page directly.
