My personal website

# Built with
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - static website generator built with golang
* [hyde-x](https://github.com/zyro/hyde-x) - hugo theme for personal blogs by [zyro](https://github.com/zyro)

I used to use WordPress, I know I will never go back to it since I knew [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). If you never used Hugo before, I highly recommend you give it a try, you don't need to know golang  to use Hugo.
